## TODO

Archit:
* `pip install neural-pipeline-search` for HPO of surrogate (Archit) -- include in documentation
* Reference section of Readme/Documentation explaining how to install optional components in the section "Usage"


Danny
* Placeholders Documentation
* https://github.com/automl/jahs_bench_201_experiments mention
* Go over README
* Experiments repo fill

Maciej
* We provide code to follow our evaluation protocols

Open
* Documentation at https://automl.github.io/jahs_bench_201/
* Put on pypi
* Fix: The 'automl/jahs_bench_201' repository doesn't contain the 'TODO' path in 'main'.


From appendix copied:


    * Dataset Documentation \todo{Mostly requirements from NeurIPS}
        * URL to the dataset and its metadata (must be structured; the guidelines mention using a web standard like schema.org or DCAT for this)
        * Instructions on accessing the dataset
        * Datasheets - for us, this would be broad properties such as the format, disk space requirements, table dimensions, other metadata. \todo{Is there a standard framework that we can use?}
        * License and author statement, ethical/responsible use guidelines. Author statement that they bear all responsibility in case of violation of rights, etc., and confirmation of the data license.
        * Recommended from the guidelines: accountability framework
        * Hosting, licensing and maintenance plan. Clarify long-term preservation.
        * Highly recommended: a persistent dereferenceable identifier, e.g. DOI or prefix from identifiers.org. (We already are on GitHub)
        * Compute usage
        * Ethics statement
    * API/Git Repo [Referenced by section 1]
        * Detailed instructions for using the dataset.
        * Minimum Working Example(s)
        * Reproducibility documentation - instructions, data, code.
