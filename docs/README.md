# Introduction

JAHS-Bench-201 is the first collection of surrogate benchmarks for Joint Architecture and Hyperparameter Search, built to support and
facilitate research on multi-objective, cost-aware and (multi) multi-fidelity optimization algorithms.


## Installation

Using pip

```bash
pip install jahs_bench_201
```

## Verify Installation

This is a minimum working example to test if the installation was successful:

```bash
python -m jahs_bench_201_examples.mwe
```

This should randomly sample a configuration and display both the sampled configuration and the result of querying the
surrogate for that configuration.


## Usage
